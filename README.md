# ULTRA WIDE BAND (UWB)

##Project description
This project report explores the capabilities of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for indoor positioning and secure data transfer between two devices. The main aim is to compare UWB technology with existing technologies with focus on Bluetooth and GPS, investigating how UWB can solve business challenges related to precise indoor location tracking and secure communication. 

For an efficient and proper investigation, we are using three **ESP32 UWB modules** for testing purposes. These modules serve as the core hardware for our experimental setup, which then allows us to evaluate UWB’s performance in real-world scenarios. The ESP32 UWB modules combine the processing power of the **ESP32 microcontroller** with **UWB transceivers**, enabling accurate distance measurement and data exchange between devices. Their compact design and integration flexibility make them ideal for prototyping and field testing in dynamic environments

For this project, we are focusing on a real-life application of this technology in use for Hockey Sport.
